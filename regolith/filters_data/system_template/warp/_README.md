# Warp System
This system stores all warp functions of the map. 
If you want to store your warp functions in your system, just make sure to merge them into the warp file.

There are two warp types which are used in the content guides:

- Key Locations: These are locations in the map that are vital for gameplay. This could be places that the player gets teleported to, the spawn point, the area of a base, etc.
- Landmarks: These are landmarks that the user can use to navigate somewhere. For example if an NPC says: "Go in the direction of that Vulcano", but the vulcano is actually not the destination, but rather a direction, then this needs to added to the landmark warps.
